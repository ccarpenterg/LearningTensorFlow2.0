Learning TensorFlow 2.0 Notebooks
=================================

## Running TensorFlow on Colab

### 1) Getting Started in TensorFlow 2.0: Training a Neural Network on MNIST

In this notebook, we train a shallow neural network to classify handwritten digits. We'll be using the tf.keras module which conveniently hides a lot of the complexity of neural networks.

We train our neural network on the MNIST dataset, which is the "hello world" of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms.

### 2) Introduction to Convoutional Neural Networks with TensorFlow
